                        <p>I have been around different cultures having lived in the Cincinnati Metropolitan Area and residing in both Northern New Jersey and the Jersey Shore. I enjoy working out regularly, reading, playing chess, and socializing. I consider myself an effective communicator and highly flexible in various social situations, no matter how challenging. Currently my interests fall in Software Development and using each day to improve my knowledge and mastery of the topic. I am 28 and feel like I finally have some good life experience under my belt. I look forward to what the future can bring and continuing to evolve with the frequent changes we face in today's 2023 world.</p>
